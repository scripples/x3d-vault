## Course Description  
The idea of 3D media is straightforward; we all know what it is. Things (animations, films, images, environments, objects, games, experiences really) that are made with software that approximate the world, volumetrically speaking. Understandable, good! To approximate the experience of moving space by means of a surface – not captured, but created – the idea feels almost sacred. Offer a prayer to Disney-Pixar.  

So why experimental? Much of the historical telos of 3D media has been its own erasure – as time goes on, the signs of software are ever more artfully erased from big-budget productions for the sake of immersion, or more grotesquely, verisimilitude. Large-budget VFX studios creating synthetic disasters, literal larger-than-life explosions (they’d really look like that if they happened!). Experimentalism, in this case, is using media in a conscious way. Its telos will not and cannot be its own erasure, but work created with this in mind will be replete with its particular mode of creation.

Experimental 3D means, then, to have the license to do things you’re not supposed to do with 3D media. To use both its affordances and its weird little crummy edges in a conscious way. To use it to address topics that studios (and capital) couldn’t care less about, in ways that reject their obsessive polishing, and to use these tools to talk about how we came to use them in the first place.

## Course Outcomes / Objectives  
The objective of this course is to provide students with a technical foundation for 3D work, as well as a broad conceptual introduction to some of the ideas at the forefront of experimental 3D work today. The course begins with basic compositional exercises using fundamental 3D tools and progresses steadily into 4D compositions.  

Students will accomplish both a large number of studies, as well as two longer-form projects in the form of a midterm and a final project.

## Course Supplies  
Please ensure that you have at least 250GB of free disk space in one form or another for the purposes of this class. I highly suggest the purchase of an external hard drive with at least 1 TB of storage; this will serve you long past the confines of this class and will provide you a space both to work from and to store archival-quality versions of your work.  

You will also need to purchase a mouse if you do not have one already and intend to do any work on a laptop. A mouse will be essential for interfacing with the software efficiently; a touchpad just simply isn’t fast enough, and will just make life harder.  

## Assignments  
There are two types of assignments in this course -- a series of 'studies' largely derived from Bauhaus-style exercises, and two projects that must be first proposed and then critiqued. You will be able to find the material requirements for each assignment on Canvas.  

The small studies are intended to be low-stakes, and to not take much time at all. I am generally a process-over-product type of person, and these exercises are designed with iteration and short feedback loops in mind.

## Attendance  
It is not advisable that you miss class unless absolutely necessary. We will be covering a lot of ground, and as the skills we will cover build on themselves, it will be difficult to catch up once you begin to fall behind. If you must miss a class, please contact me as early as you are able, and I’ll do my best to ensure you’re kept up to speed.  

Please do not be late to class – two late arrivals will count as a single absence. If a student accrues more than three absences, they will not receive credit for the course.  

You are more than welcome to step out of class freely and as needed, but please do so sparingly if able. We will take periodic breaks to stretch, walk around, etc.  

## Course Credit  
Students must complete all assignments in order to receive credit for the course.
